# glTFRuntimeConvexCollisions

Convex Collisions support for glTFRuntime

This plugin makes use of the amazing V-HACD library (https://github.com/kmammou/v-hacd used by Unreal too) for generating Convex Collisions.

You can use this plugin as a base for adding more runtime features to your StaticMeshes or to understand the "CustomConfig" system used by glTFRuntime.
